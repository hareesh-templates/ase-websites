                <p>Eswari Homes Consultancy Pvt Ltd (and its direct or indirect subsidiaries, affiliates, referred to
collectively as ‘Eswari Homes’ or Eswari Group) acts as a broker between the
developer/property owner (Counterparty) and you (the Buyer). Eswari Homes receives
remuneration for its services from the Counterparty or from the Buyer and do not act as an
independent advisor. </p>
<p>This advisory cannot disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of the
investment/purchase you have made through us, but it is intended to give you information
and awareness of the risks associated with them so that you are reasonably able to
understand the nature and risks of the specific types of investment being offered and,
consequently, to take investment decisions on an informed basis.</p>
<p>You should invest in these or any other products only after you understand the nature of the
contract you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to risk. You should also be
satisfied that the particular investment is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and
financial position and, where necessary, you should seek appropriate independent legal
and/or financial advice in advance of any investment decisions.</p>
<p>All property and/or structured investments carry a certain degree of risk including market
risks, liquidity risks, counterparty risks, etc. The types of risk that might be of concern will
depend on various matters, including how the investment is created, structured or drafted</p>
<p>Under construction properties carry specific delivery risks depending on the track record of
the developer, their financial status, project approval status, local political and social situation,
delay in delivery of products, unauthorized change in the promised specifications and
layouts, etc.</p>
<p>Assured returns, guaranteed buybacks and similar products carry counterparty risks of
fulfilment of commitments. The value of your investment can fluctuate according to market
conditions and past performance is not an accurate guide to future value. Rental income and
capital returns are dependent on a number of factors including economic conditions (the
housing market, inflation, interest rates) and the property itself (property condition, location).</p>
<p>A number of factors influence the risks associated with investing beyond one’s home country.
Exposure to differing economies can produce higher or lower risk, further the transaction is
subject to foreign laws and to any change in policies and rules in the country where the
property is located.</p>
<p>Risk factors may occur simultaneously and/or may compound each other resulting in an
unpredictable effect on the value of any investment. In any of the situations, the use of
leverage (which has the effect of magnifying potential positive or negative outcomes) may
significantly increase the impact on you of any of the risks described.</p>

<ol>
