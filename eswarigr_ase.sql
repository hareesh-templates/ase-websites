It is the most needed factor to rank among the top competitors and to make the website more accessible and visible to the customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People these days understand and appreciate the importance of search engine optimization (SEO) and its benefits. However, they still wonder whether or not SEO is necessary and if it can bring them any profit. In this article we will be addressing the most common questions about SEO and explaining why you need to use SEO for better ranking, return on investment and profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>SEO services in Hyderabad</strong></a> have been flourishing for quite some time now. There are a number of <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>SEO companies in Hyderabad</strong></a> that offer a wide range of services from small businesses to big corporations. But before you dive into the world of SEO, there are some important factors that you need to keep in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Is SEO?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of getting traffic from search engines. There are many ways to use SEO for better ranking, ROI and profits. It can be a long and drawn-out process of months, but it is a method of getting a lot of traffic to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is one of the most important aspects of running a successful business. You can have the most amazing product or service in the world, but if nobody knows about it, it&rsquo;s not going to sell. SEO gives you the power to control your online presence and get more customers and clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Here are the reasons why you need to use SEO:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improves the SEO ranking of your website in search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase in high-quality inbound links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solves the search engine optimization problem in local areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Builds brand awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improves ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Are The Components in SEO Services?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Content really is everything, at least if you want to rank high on search results. Initially, search engines placed a lot of weight on purely keywords in content, but have since made it pretty clear that good content will help your website with users&#39; experience so long as it contains certain key terms. Good content is one main way to educate potential customers about you and your business as well as relating with them via the social media channels. Additionally, creating better quality content will help with customer engagement, which causes your business to earn more profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last few years, search engine algorithms have changed significantly and now they factor in a lot more than meets the eye. In fact, all kinds of UX elements play a role in how well your site ranks in SERPs. That&rsquo;s because Google has come to understand that your users vote for you and then Google uses that data to determine where each site should rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backlinks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next technique you should familiarize yourself with is making backlinks. You must remember not to focus on quantity but rather quality. Create monthly press releases and contact blogs that offer interesting information related to your business niche. Create strategies with which you can get backlinks using their sites and help them promote your business content in exchange for a hyperlink in the end. The most important thing in this process is having a site that readers will like and trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After back links, it is important to focus on cross links. It&rsquo;s not about getting the most number of links but creating quality content, which can also be relevant to your target audience. If you are in the hotel business for example, create news that is relevant to this area along with bi-monthly press releases that discuss exciting events at the hotel. Approach blogs and news sites with information about this niche link back. Such sites are likely to accept your news since it has relevant information for their readers. Create an interesting website which is beneficial for attraction of traffic from other sites or internet resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keywords</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to attract the right traffic to your site and generate income and leads for your business, then understanding and promoting keywords is vital. Some ways in which one can start this process is by thinking about the words that people might generally look up when searching for sites like yours. You could also do keyword research, which is a great way to root out the best keywords to use in SEO (Search engine optimization) and PPC (Pay per click). Ensure that the results of your search really spell out what you&#39;re all about too because that&#39;ll encourage people who find themselves at the top of your list looking through your content or making a purchase from any links on your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keyword research is one of the most useful tools for driving targeted traffic to your website. Think about what keywords you think are relevant people might be using on search engines to find your site - then compare them against the keywords that are being used in Google ads. If you find it&#39;s difficult to find long-tail keywords with few competitors, consider creating content based around the specific types of information users are searching for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rankings on the various search engines like Google and Yahoo! and Bing, etc. have evolved over time with the emergence of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn and even Pinterest . These types of social media sites give companies a chance to build a strong awareness for their brand through community building. That&#39;s why ecommerce companies should make sure that they create a great sense of &quot;social-media web authority&quot; in addition to traditional &quot;search engine authority&quot; when trying to establish web presence online these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to searches on PPC sites, there are several factors that come into play. For example if you&#39;re using the right keyword phrases it would be much easier for your site to appear in the top ten results of Google or Bing. To do this, it&#39;s important that you take advantage of social media by creating relevant content through Facebook, Twitter , LinkedIn and Pinterest . Doing so will position your company as an industry leader and help you develop customer loyalty through these platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product Images</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think product pictures are not important for your SEO strategy, you are mistaken.

(48, 'Digital Marketing Vs Traditional Marketing: Which is Better?', 'Vizag', '<p>Traditional and digital marketing techniques and strategies are two different concepts and tools that can help your business grow and flourish. You need to use both of these techniques and strategies to ensure that your business grows and remains successful. This blog will look at <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>Digital marketing Vs Traditional marketing</strong></a> and how we can ensure that your business benefits the most from these two marketing strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What works for one company might not work for another. Every company has a different approach to marketing, but at the end of the day, they are always hoping to reach the same goal - to sell more. But are all these marketing methods the same, or are they different in some ways? Some companies still prefer traditional marketing over digital marketing, but others swear by digital marketing. It&#39;s not uncommon to hear opinions about how digital marketing is better than traditional marketing. One of the reasons for this is because digital marketing is much more precise - you can be more focused on who you are reaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your marketing efforts should be based on your business goals and the type of clients you want to attract. Which is the better marketing type? Is it digital or traditional marketing? Digital marketing has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, but traditional marketing, including free press releases, still holds a lot of power. Both marketing methods have their respective pros and cons. You have to think of the many different aspects of marketing before you decide which one you need. It can be quite confusing. However, once you know which one fits you, you can easily make the choice.&nbsp; You just have to decide which one fits your business the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>What is traditional marketing</strong></a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional marketing is a term that refers to all the marketing activities that have been used in the past. It covers a wide spectrum of advertising and communication techniques that have been used as far as the beginning of the industrial revolution. It refers to the traditional way of marketing, which relies on one-to-one communication with the customers. The traditional marketing methods are still used today because they are effective and they can be adapted to suit many different business models. There are many traditional marketing methods that are still very popular, such as TV commercials, billboards, print ads, direct mail, radio, and even word of mouth. Traditional marketing is still alive and kicking, because it is cost-effective and engaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You get high visibility but no control over your product. Traditional marketing is highly visible, but it&rsquo;s not very flexible. It&rsquo;s expensive, and it requires you to get other people to do your marketing for you. Traditional marketing can be broken down into three different types: print, radio, and TV. These three types of traditional marketing are also known as offline marketing. Traditional marketing is great, but it can be difficult to track your ad spend and conversions. Traditional marketing is not always the best choice for small businesses, but it can be used for large companies that have extremely high budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>What is digital marketing</strong></a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital marketing is a form of marketing that uses digital channels to reach consumers.

Digital marketing is also commonly referred to as online marketing, Internet marketing, e-marketing, or web marketing. Digital marketing is considered one of the most cost-effective ways to reach consumers.

But while the digital world has changed the way we market, traditional marketing still has its place. So, how do digital and traditional marketing overlap? When should you use one over the other? Both digital and traditional marketing have their own advantages and disadvantages. The following are some of the ways in which they overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&#39;s a business or a blog, digital marketing is the way of the future -- but does traditional marketing still have a place? And how do they overlap? Digital marketing is generally considered to be any marketing that uses the internet, social media, or mobile technology. Traditional marketing, on the other hand, is limited to print advertising, radio advertising, and television advertising. Both types of marketing have their own pros and cons, but they&#39;re also very different -- which means they&#39;re often used in different ways</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do the differences between the two affect your business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In business, there are two main types of marketing methods: digital marketing and traditional marketing. While digital marketing is a newer way of marketing, traditional marketing has been around for a longer period of time.

But you cannot ignore the fact that digital marketing is also very popular nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>Digital marketing advantages</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital marketing is not so different from the traditional marketing methods. The only difference is the time and the technology. Digital marketing and traditional marketing both have their advantages and disadvantages.

(72, '5 Pros and Cons of Social media marketing in business', 'Hyderabad', '<p>In case you&#39;re stepping forward to a digital marketing plan let me introduce you to the main advantages of <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>social media marketing</strong></a>, in other words, social media marketing benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Using social media you can reach your target audience anytime and also stay connected with them. This is one of the most obvious social media marketing advantages. Half of world&#39;s population is into social media, which makes it one of the most advantageous platform for <strong><a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\">digital marketing</a>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Through social media posts you have high chances of having your content go viral. Besides that, you can also benefit from user generated content. Through this users make content without having you participated. This saves you a lot of time. This also acts as a very strong social proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Using social media you can easily find out what users really think of you with the help of social media monitoring tools. It helps you to know more about the user&#39;s sentiments related to your product or service. You can always find out what users think of your brand and you also can keep a track of your user&#39;s perception of your brand compared to your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. It is only through social media that you get familiarized with trends and hot topics for discussion. It is one of the best social media marketing advantages to promote and enhance your brand digitally. With Hashtagify and Google Trends you can find the most trending hashtags for Instagram and Twitter&nbsp;and also discover trendy topics for your SMM posts. By analyzing this given data, you can come up with ideas of your own to engage with possible clients and make them participate in your discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The most convenient and most innovative way to engage with audiences is the use of social media. Users have an easy access to connect with a brand or company through social media, which saves them the time and effort of calling the support team or mailing them personally. Introducing a chat bot is way more helpful as customers expect expect responses at least within an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social Media has both advantages and disadvantages, and thus, the blog here covers the topic social media marketing advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. When you use social media to promote your brands or services, you get to know a little too much about human nature. You also learn that users won&#39;t always respond positively. As long as you do them good toh can expect good, in case they don&#39;t like anything be ready to face the lows. At least that&#39;s what social media analytics say. You can satisfy people, and that&#39;s right, but if you think you can satisfy everybody then you&#39;re mistaken because you cannot. Each negative review if seen by your current customers you&#39;ll definitely lose them with utmost possibility. But what you can do here to save yourself is look into the review your clients give and then go stay fixing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Contents on social media are innumerable. Therefore there&#39;s a high chance for customers and clients to get bored. So what can keep them interested is anything new. In order to engage customers continuously you will have to come up with something new almost every day. You may have to go live, post new contents, share jokes or anything that can generate leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. There&#39;s no prohibition when it comes to a small scale business or a large scale. Basically the size of your business doesn&#39;t impact your goals. But what impacts is the kind or type of business you&#39;re into. Since some of the hashtags are prohibited to be used, so if your product or service falls under these hashtags you may not be able to gain a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. You cannot reach all segments of users. Since everyone is not good with what you&#39;re good at they may expect something else for them to deal better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Advertising on social media can be really expensive. It can save you money only if you can set your social media marketing campaigns correctly. In the event of a mistake with the target audience, region, or language of the advertising campaign, there are big risks that waste your social media marketing budget and get zero ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just how there exists social media marketing benefits, so does the drawbacks of it. Therefore to business digitally and successfully you got to overcome the hurdles and makes your way out by multiplying the benefits.

So let&#39;s just start without wandering much on the edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is On-Page SEO?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another term for On-page SEO is On-site SEO. On-page SEO is the practice in which contents of web pages are optimized for users as well as search engines. Some of the common on-page SEO practices are optimizing contents, internal links, title tags, URLs etc. On-page SEO has the power to bring countless new visitors and customers to your website. On-page SEO is on-page optimization of various components of your website so that your website is ranked on search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main factors depending upon which Google&#39;s algorithm ranks your website. They are on page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO. Now that we told you what on page SEO is let us quickly brief you on what is off page and technical SEO. Off-page SEO refers to social sharing, external linking and more. Whereas technical SEO refers to all the search engine optimization elements not included in on-page and off-page practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Importance of On-page SEO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is because of on-page SEO that Google knows all about your website and how you provide value to your clients. It helps in optimizing your site for both search engine bots as well as for human eyes. Just getting your website created is not and never enough. You must optimize it in order for you to be found by other search engines. Only through this can you rank higher in the search results and attract more and more customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some of the on-page SEO elements are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. High Quality Page Content -</strong> it is what you call heart of on page SEO. It tells your visitors as well as readers and search engines about your website as well as business. You can create high quality contents when you choose and use keywords and topics that are of high quality as well as relevant. You can conduct keyword research by searching terms on Google that are used by your competitors and other websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Page Titles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The title tag that your website page bears is very important for on-page SEO. With the titles being sharp and attractive your visitors will know what they are to find on your web page. While developing page titles keep it under 70 characters in order for your title to not be cut off of search results. Make it as relevant as possible and avoid using all caps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Internal Linking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal linking is the process of hyperlinking to other helpful pages on your website.

Google has been pushing hard for HTTPS everywhere so that web becomes a safer place to surf. Security is the number one reason why it&#39;s being pushed so hard by Google. But there are other reasons or advantages as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Performance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTTP/2 is being rolled out by content delivery networks and web hosting providers. To take advantage of HTTP/2 performance benefits you have to be running over HTTPS because of browser support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. SEO and Rankings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTTPS can help you improve your SEO rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. More Secure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important reason like we mentioned before of converting HTTP into HTTPS is security. If you aren&#39;t running over an HTTPS connection your username and password are sent in clear text over the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Builds Trust and Credibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps you build your trust and credibility with your visitors.

The first and foremost thing is that you&#39;ll need SSL Certificate. These are small data files which binds a key to a specific organization&#39;s details. When it is installed it activates the HTTPS protocol which allows a secure connection between a web browser and a server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Depending on what software you&#39;re running the steps to install SSL Certificate can vary. Once you have installed your certificate you will want to check to see if there are any issues with it. The following tools can be very helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Using relative URLs is always the best practice but there will always be times when someone has hard coded a URL and so you will want to do a full sweep on your site and database during an HTTP to HTTPS migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Adding 301 redirects to new HTTPS URLs is probably one of the most important steps in converting HTTP to HTTPS. 301 redirects are a permanent redirect which passes between 90-99% of ranking power to the redirected page.

But in your head you should know what to do and why. Read this cohesive step-by-step blueprint to get started with your <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>social media strategy</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Choose your social networks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media can be of different types but homogeneous too. But each social media network is unique in its own way. All the networks have their own style, own audience and own practices. You must choose the social media platform that suits your social media goal the best. You are not required to be on all social media platforms, just be on the ones that matter to you and your audience. While figuring out which social media site is more engaging you must find out where do your potential customers hang out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Fill out your profiles completely</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of your important concerns should be to visit each of your social media profiles and make sure that everything into the profile such as profile photo, cover photo, bio are all upto date and complete. A complete profile will make an impression. A completed profile shows professionalism, cohesive branding, and a signal to visitors that you&rsquo;re serious about engaging. Also audience should be able to find familiarity between different social media pages of your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Pick your posting strategy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For someone dealing with social media what to post, how often to post and when to post is a big question. But the answer for this is it depends. For every other company there&#39;s a different social media strategy. What may work for you may not work for another businessman and what may work for him may not work for you. But we&#39;d still give you a general idea as to what can fetch in attention. Fir example videos are ideal for engagement. Whichever social media platform you may be using you&#39;ll see a plethora of videos. Video posts are likely to get more likes, views and shares. If people respond to your posts more then you can choose to post more and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Analyze and test</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you post and get used to social media you&#39;ll get to know which content, timing, and frequency is right for you. It&rsquo;s best to get&nbsp;a social media analytics tool. Most major social networks will have basic analytics built into the site. It&rsquo;s just a little easier to seek and find this information from an all-encompassing dashboard. These tools show you a breakdown of how each post performed in the important areas of views, clicks, shares, likes, and comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Automate and engage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must follow up with your audiences, to stay on top of updates, since this is the best way to engage with your audiences. You can begin with automating posting of your social media content. Create all the content that you want to post all at once and then place everything into a queue to be sent out according to whatever schedule you choose. This way you&#39;ll consistently share, day after day. Automation isn&#39;t the end of your social media strategy. You must engage with your customers too. When people connect with you, you must connect back. Set a particular time of the day to carry out these conversations. These are conversations with potential customers, references, friends, and colleagues.

(98, 'A Step-by-Step Guide to Advertising on Facebook', 'Vizag', '<p>Paid advertising on social media platforms is an immediate way to reach your content to a wider audience. Facebook has 2.91 billion active users which makes it the most popular social media platform for running ads. Obviously you want your ad to be seen and for it to be seen on Facebook you&#39;ll have to pay for it. Understanding how to conduct <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>advertising on Facebook</strong></a> is a must if you have a business online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before you get into the step-by-step guide to advertising on Facebook, you must know why you&#39;re advertising and what you&#39;re objectives are which you want to achieve. The point is, you should think about your reason for advertising before you create a campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create an ad account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook gives you a personal ad account by default when you sign up for Facebook. To find it you need to go to Ads Manager and look closely into the upper left hand corner. To use this Facebook Ads Manager you need to have a Facebook page, and a verified payment method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: Head over to Facebook Ads Manager</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whichever Facebook ads campaign you come across it&#39;s due to the Facebook Ads Manager tool. To navigate to Ads Manager right from your business page, head to the left sidebar and click on the &ldquo;Ad Center&rdquo; drop-down arrow of any Facebook page, then choose &ldquo;All Ads&rdquo; from the drop-down. At the bottom of that page, there is an option to click &ldquo;Ads Manager.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose your objective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll find a green button saying &quot;Create ad&quot;, you need to click on it to start with your first ad. Once you do that Facebook will take you to a page whereyou will be prompted to choose a campaign objective. You have many different ways of approaching an ad campaign based on what you wish to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4: Set your campaign budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important thing about <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>ad management services</strong></a> is that how much you would want to spend on the ad. The budget that you set should represent the maximum amount of money you want to spend. You can set your budget per day or as a total amount for the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5: Customize your target audience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook wouldn&#39;t just show your ad to the random audience. A strategically determined audience is crucial to the success of your Facebook ad campaign and therefore you need to customize your target audience based on location, age, gender, language, interests, behavior, etc. You can also further customize your targeting using&nbsp;custom audiences&nbsp;for retargeting people who have already interacted with your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 6: Choose your ad placements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is basically where your ad appears to be visible to your target audience. Based on your objective and goal, you may choose to show your ad on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, or any other platform that you may prefer. You can choose to make your ad appear in feed, stories and reels, search, messages, apps and sites, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 7: Create your advertisement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the step where you need to create your ad and its the fun part of it. If you choose to create your ad from the scratch you need to select a format. You&rsquo;ve probably seen many of the Facebook Ads formats on your personal feed, but your choices will vary based on the objective you set for your ad during Step 3. Based on your campaign objective Facebook will recommend one or more ad format to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 8: Place your order</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To finally submit your ad you need to click the &#39;publish&#39; button. You&#39;ll find it at the bottom right-hand corner of the page. Once you submit your freshly created ad Facebook has to review it to check that it fits their specs and doesn&rsquo;t violate their community guidelines. It gets reviewed within 24hrs. Once the ad is live you&#39;ll receive a confirmation email from Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow these steps to create your first ever Facebook ad and run it live to reach your customized audience.

(99, 'YouTube ads and their types', 'Vizag', '<p>It was fifteen years ago that YouTube came into existence. It still is one of the most used online platforms amongst all other search engines. Running behind Google it is the second largest search engine in the world. It was in the year 2007 that YouTube first opened its doors to advertisers. But now at present the amount of advertisements we come across before, during or in the middle of YouTube video has increased at least ten fold. When you switch on to YouTube to watch a 2 to 3 minutes video and you&#39;re made to watch these display ads it really seems Iike a battle. But then that&#39;s the reality of online marketing today. However, let&#39;s just get into the details of the 5 different types of YouTube ads that the advertisers may use to bring a change to their businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <strong>Skippable In-Stream Video Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skippable instream video ads are displayed either before a video or during the video. For the first five seconds you have to watch them and only then can you skip the advertisement. The minimum length of a video should be 12 seconds and it cannot be more than 3 minutes so marketers must focus on keeping it under 3 minutes. The advancement of skippable in stream video ads is that you get charged only if someone watches at least 3 seconds of the advertisement, the entire ad or if they click on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Non-Skippable In-Stream Video Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like skippable instream videos these advertisements too can be displayed either before or during the video. The only difference is that these ads don&#39;t give you the option to skip. The non-skippable ad is best when your brand really needs to raise awareness and doesn&rsquo;t want to risk getting hundreds and thousands of ad skips. The way you are charged for these ads is a bit different. <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>Advertisers pay per impression</strong></a> for these advertisement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Bumper Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bumper Ads are six second long videos that are played right before an actual video. And also you cannot skip bumper advertisements. If you got a simple message that you want to put across this ad is the best suitable. Again, these ads are a great spot for any awareness efforts like promoting an event, or driving brand reach and frequency. If a 6-second spot seems too short to make a lasting impact, Google analyzed 300 bumper ads and found that&nbsp;90% created a big lift in ad recall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Discovery Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discovery Ads are not like the ones mentioned above. It is different from them. They are in fact similar to Google search ads. They appear among results in an organic way. Because of these ad audience views YouTube as a search engine. Discovery ads are composed of a thumbnail image and three lines of text. What&rsquo;s also interesting is that these ads can show on the search results page, video watch page, and YouTube homepage which gives them quite a bit of visibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Non-video Ads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For brands and companies that want to save on spending there are non video ads that YouTube has in store. First, you can choose to serve a display ad on the right hand side of results while a video is playing. This ad features an image, some text to the right of the image, and a button to click to your website. Also, can serve a banner ad overlay that pops up during a video from a channel that&rsquo;s decided to monetize.

(101, 'What is Technical SEO? How it is important to the website', 'Vizag', '<p>Technical SEO is all about the ways to <a href=\"https://asetechnologies.in/\"><strong>optimize your site technically</strong></a>. It is how website is optimized in order to increase the ranking of its pages in the search engines. Making a website faster, easier to crawl, and more understandable for search engines are the pillars of technical optimization. Technical SEO is part of&nbsp;on-page SEO, which focuses on improving elements&nbsp;on&nbsp;your website to get higher rankings. It&rsquo;s the opposite of&nbsp;off-page SEO, which is about generating exposure for a website through other channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google and other search engines want to present their users with the best possible results for their queries. Therefore,&nbsp;Google&rsquo;s robots crawl and evaluate web pages on a multitude of factors. Some factors are based on the user&rsquo;s experience, like how fast a page loads. Other factors help search engine robots grasp what your pages are about. This is what, among others, structured data does. So, by improving technical aspects, you help search engines crawl and understand your site. If you do this well, you might be rewarded with higher rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Technical SEO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. It&#39;s fast - </strong>Nowadays, web pages need to load fast. People are impatient and don&rsquo;t want to wait for a page to open. Research from 2016 shows that&nbsp;53% of mobile website visitors will leave&nbsp;if a webpage doesn&rsquo;t open within three seconds. And the trend hasn&rsquo;t gone away, research from 2022 suggests the same. So if your website is slow, people get frustrated and move on to another website, and you&rsquo;ll miss out on all that traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. It&#39;s crawlable for search engine -</strong> Search engines use robots to crawl, or spider, your website. The robots follow links to discover content on your site. A&nbsp;great internal linking structure&nbsp;will make sure that they&rsquo;ll understand what the most important content on your site is. But there are more ways to guide robots. You can, for instance, block them from crawling certain content if you don&rsquo;t want them to go there. You can also let them crawl a page, but tell them not to show this page in the search results or not to follow the links on that page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. It doesn&#39;t have many dead links -</strong> What might be even more annoying for visitors than a slow page, is landing on a page that doesn&rsquo;t exist at all. If a link leads to a non-existing page on your site, people will encounter a 404 error page. There goes your carefully crafted user experience! What&rsquo;s more, search engines don&rsquo;t like to find these error pages either. And, they tend to find even more dead links than visitors encounter because they follow every link they bump into, even if it&rsquo;s hidden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. It&#39;s secure - </strong>A technically optimized website is a secure website. Making your website safe for users to guarantee their privacy is a basic requirement nowadays. There are&nbsp;many things you can do to make your website secure, and one of the most crucial things is implementing HTTPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTTPS makes sure that nobody can intercept the data that&rsquo;s sent over between the browser and the site. So, for instance, if people log in to your site, their credentials are safe. You&rsquo;ll need something called an SSL certificate to implement HTTPS on your site. Google acknowledges the importance of security and therefore&nbsp;made HTTPS a ranking signal through which secure websites rank higher than unsafe equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. It has structured data -</strong> Structured data helps search engines better understand your website, content, or even your business. With&nbsp;structured data&nbsp;you can tell search engines what kind of product you sell, or which recipes you have on your site. Plus, it will give you the opportunity to provide all kinds of details about those products or recipes.</p>\r\n', '12-September-2022', 'what-is-technical-seo-how-it-is-important-to-the-website', 'asetech66.jpg', 'Technical SEO is all about the ways to optimize your site technically.
