                                They are made up of wires, brackets, and bands. Braces aid to correct irregular teeth positioning,
                                jaw correction, improvement in chewing and smile aesthetics. Dental braces are used by dentists in
                                orthodontic treatment for a variety of reasons. One of their most common uses, however,
                                is in the correction of crooked teeth or a bad bite. By straightening your teeth and enhancing
                                your oral hygiene, you will stop the onset of gum diseases, which are the main reason for tooth loss.

                                Aside from straightening your teeth, braces can also correct other issues, such as malocclusions.
                                A malocclusion becomes harmful over time and results in apparent clenching and grinding of your teeth.
                                Overlapping teeth are more inclined to dental injuries. Dental clips can move these teeth back into
                                their perfect positions and control any injuries. In some serious cases, misaligned teeth could push
                                mouth bacteria to wear out the bones under your teeth. Braces help control this through their
                                realignment of teeth. There are different types of dental braces available in the market,
                                but you need to consult your dentist and ask for the suggestion for a speedy recovery.
