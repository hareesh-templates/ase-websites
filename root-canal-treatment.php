                            <p>
                                A badly damaged or infected tooth can be repaired and saved through a procedure called Root canal treatment.
                                Like earlier days root canal procedure is not painful anymore, it starts with administration of local
                                anaesthesia, removal of damaged or infected tooth structure followed by disinfection , proper cleaning ,
                                sealing of tooth roots with a permanent filling followed by a crown.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a tooth cavity / chip/ crack is not treated in time we might experience severe sensitivity , pain, swelling.
                                In severe cases swelling may be associated with pus discharge. We at PARIMI’S dental care are very well trained
