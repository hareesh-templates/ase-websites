                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dental implants are basically medical devices that are implanted in your jaw with the help of dental surgery
                                to restore your ability to chew, or to provide support to artificial teeth. When you lose a teeth either
                                because of any injury or due to a disease an individual may experience complications such as rapid bone loss,
                                defective speech, or changes to chewing patterns that result in discomfort. Replacing a lost tooth with
                                a dental implant can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and health.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The dental implant medical device is surgically inserted in the jawbone in place of the tooth's root.
                                Dental implant systems consist of a dental implant body and dental implant abutment and may also include
                                an abutment fixation screw. The dental implant abutment is usually attached to the implant body by the
                                abutment fixation screw and extends through gums into the mouth to support the attached artificial teeth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But before you make up your mind for dental implants you must speak to your dentist about whether it
                                is a fit for you or not and also about the pros and cons. Your overall health is an important factor
                                in determining whether you are a good candidate for dental implants, how long it will take to heal,
                                and how long the implant may stay in place.
