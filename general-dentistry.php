                                    Ruling out any dental problems in an initial stage is very important as every condition
                                    to reach the next stage requires six months to progress hence a mandatory dental checkup
                                    is advised once in six months , any procedures done in the initial phase will be with less discomfort,
                                    mostly painless and minimally invasive. For any of the above a proper Diagnosis and knowing
                                    the patients problem is very important in which PARIMI’S dental care stands up to their expertise.
