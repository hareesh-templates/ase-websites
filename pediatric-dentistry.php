                                Pediatric Dentistry is mainly for the treatment of the oral health of children from infancy through
                                their teen years. The pediatric dentists in Vizag have the experience and qualifications to take care of
                                the child's teeth, gums and mouth. Also know as children dentist they have their own specialty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Children are the ones most prone to oral problems and for them there is pediatric Dentistry which
                                focuses solely on the oral hygiene and health of children and teens. Specialized care is provided to
                                the children targeted to fulfill their particular requirements and it is very different from what
                                general dentistry is. Prevention and treatment are the primary focus of pediatric Dentistry as it deals
                                with a specific age group of infants and children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Issues like carious cavities to mal-aligned teeth and any other kind of oral lesions are also addressed.
                                With the experience and qualifications to care for a childâ€™s teeth, gums, and mouth throughout the various
                                stages of childhood pediatric Dentistry is a very important section of dentistry in general.
                                Without proper dental care, children face possible oral decay and disease that can cause a lifetime of
                                pain and complications. Children are not just small adults.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They are not always able to be patient and cooperative during a dental exam.
                                Pediatric dentists know how to examine and treat children in ways that make them comfortable.
                                In addition, pediatric dentists use specially designed equipment in offices that are arranged and
                                decorated with children in mind.
